Part One
Exercise - ROWID:
1. The output of the 18-character ROWID consists of the data object, the data block,
the row number within the block, a file number, tablespace, and database number

2. the data object number and the file number are different.

Exercise - Creating Indexes:
1.  CREATE INDEX composite_index_name
	ON Lab_Pro_Dens;
2. index_name: shows the name of the index
   visibility: whether or not the index is invisible
   tablespace_name: the tablespace name that the index is stored
   blevel: the height of the index tree. Root block = level 1, its children are level 2 etc
   leaf_blocks: the total number of leaf blocks in the index
   
Exercise - Adding a primary key:
1.  CREATE INDEX cred_index
	ON Lab_Pro_Dens (Credential, Cred_Date);
2. The visibility of the index changes from visible to invisible after adding the primary key. This
Happens because when you add a primary key constraint, oracle will auto create a unique index which enforces
the PK.

Exercise - Explain Plan for...:


PArt 2: partitioned tables:

Exercise - List Partitioning:
1. PARTITION BY LIST (Credential)
(
    PARTITION bachelors VALUES ('BDS', 'BDSc'),
    PARTITION doctors VALUES ('DDS', 'DMD'),
    PARTITION general VALUES ('GPR'),
    PARTITION unknown_cred VALUES (DEFAULT)
);

2. Inserting rows under the partition shouldnt affect space usage in a meaningful manner

3. Inserting all rows will consume a lot more space, so space usage increased in accordance with thatd

4. No, it would not give back all the space. To release it we have to execute a 'DROP TABLE' and 'PURGE'
statement

Exercise - Range Partitioning:
1. PARTITION BY RANGE (Cred_Date)
(
    PARTITION before_2011 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2011-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')) SEGMENT CREATION IMMEDIATE,
    PARTITION in_2011 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2012-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')) SEGMENT CREATION IMMEDIATE,
    PARTITION in_2012 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2013-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')) SEGMENT CREATION IMMEDIATE,
    PARTITION in_2013 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2014-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')) SEGMENT CREATION IMMEDIATE,
    PARTITION in_2014 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2015-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')) SEGMENT CREATION IMMEDIATE,
    PARTITION other_dates VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE) SEGMENT CREATION IMMEDIATE
);
